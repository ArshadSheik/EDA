# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a Data Science concept where we analyze a dataset to discover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

It helps us better understand the information contained in the dataset and guides us in making informed decisions and formulating strategies to solve real business problems.

For example, suppose a retail business is facing a drop in sales.

By performing an EDA on their sales data, we can explore various factors that may influence declining sales, such as changes in customer preferences, changes in market trends, or the impact of promotional campaigns.

## Questions to ASk from Data while performing EDA

1. How many variables/features are present?

2. What are the range, minimum, maximum, mean, and median values?

3. Are the variables normally distributed or skewed?

4. Are there any extreme values or outliers that need to be addressed?

5. Are there any strong positive or negative correlations between variables?

6. Which variables have the most significant impact on the target variable?

7. Are there any seasonality or periodic patterns?

8. Are there any increasing or decreasing trends over time?

9. Are there any clusters or groups within the data?

10. Are there any anomalies or unusual observations?

11. How does the data vary across different categories or groups?

## EDA Process:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant data from various sources, ensuring its accuracy and completeness.

2. **Data cleaning:** Perform data cleaning operations to fix missing values, manage outliers, and eliminate inconsistencies.

3. **Data Visualization:** Create visual representations of data using graphs, histograms, scatterplots, or heatmaps. Visualization helps identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data set.

4. **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate and analyze key descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles. These statistics provide insight into the dataâ€™s central tendencies, distributions, and variabilities.

5. **Correlation Analysis:** Explore relationships between variables by calculating correlation coefficients. This analysis helps identify dependencies and understand how changes in one variable affect others.
